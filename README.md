# pyrx

Fork of pyrx, A Python extension for getting RandomX hashes.
Fixed the build issues with CMake and MinGW for Windows systems, thus Visual Studio is no longer needed to compile it. 
Pre-built wheels are available for Python 3.12 Windows AMD64. (Backward compatibility not tested. Likely compatible with Py3.9+)

## Installation

```
pip install git+https://github.com/debxylen/pyrx
```

## Usage

See [tests/test.py](./tests/test.py).

## Issues and Contributing

Please open an issue or discussion in case there are any errors in installing the extension from the wheel, or building it from the source from my fork.
Contributions and suggestions are very welcome.

## License
